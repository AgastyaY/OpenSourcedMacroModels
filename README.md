# OpenSourcedModels


## Objective
The goal of this repository is to collect in one place the open-sourcd macroeconomic models, in particular (but not limited to) those used by central banks, ministries of finance and other offical sector agencies.

If you know a model that is not listed here, please open up a pull request [here](https://github.com/dkgaraujo/OpenSourcedMacroModels/pulls). PRs for corrections are also very welcome.

## Official sector models

The table below lists models that were open sourced by official sector entities themselves.
